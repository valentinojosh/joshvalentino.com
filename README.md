This site was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It heavily depends on [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for styling and responsiveness.

It is statically hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Read about enabling redirects on Netlify to fix client-side routing for SPAs [here](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/404-react-page-not-found).

Credit goes to [Karen Ying](https://github.com/karenying) for their awesome front-end project, which I used to bootstrap my own.
